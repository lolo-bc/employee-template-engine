# Employee Template Engine 

This is a comand line application that very simple to use, which prompts the user to input data about their employee's and then generates a HTML document with a styled list of all inputs and thier information. 

## How it works 

 The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of managers, engineers and interns. 

 This application uses the NPM package Inquirer to prompt the user.
